# Lectures

## Lecture 1 - Introduction to Spring boot

Purpose of this lecture is to get a first/quick introduction of what is Spring Boot and its features. 

Two small projects will be created during this course, via Spring Initializr.  The first project will be a hello word web application. Within this project the basic spring boot capabilities will be discussed and explained.

The second project will be made slightly more complex by connecting with Elasticsearch as a database and exposing a domain object over rest. The purpose here will not be to understand spring data or spring data rest but introduce a proposed project structure and explain further auto configuration and spring boot property files.

By the end of the lecture audience is expected to be able to create it own project understand the structure of spring boot and be able to run it.



Lecture 1 also has 1 exercise which should be done after the completion of 1st lecture.
